**PURPOSE**: Provide useful documentation for development.

## Installation
This website was built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

```console
yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Index

```console
yarn index 
```

If you are using [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) for index and site search, 
this command will parse data and send to *Algolia* API for index.

# GNU grep
*GNU grep* installed on MacOS.
One reason to install *GNU grep* and use instead of native MacOS *grep*,
is that it supports Perl PCRE2.
See [ripgrep](./ripgrep.md) for a good replacement of *grep*.

## Installing GNU grep on MacOS
```shell
brew install ggrep
```
See [homebrew](../mac/homebrew.md).

## References
- `man ggrep`
